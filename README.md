# grunt-contrib-docco

Grunt task to create [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/) documentation.

## Getting Started

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```
npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-docco
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-docco');
```

## Docco Task

_Run this task with the `grunt docco` command._

Automatically create documentation from comments in your source code.
